# Ensemblelearning

This is a project to detect rice leaf disease detection using ensemble learning(a machine learning approach)of DenseNet And AlexNet models. The pathological illnesses have to be tackled to increase and further improve their quality and production. The process of identifying plant pathology by machine learning models could be automated, ensuring that diseases are identified in their early stages, allowing us to take the necessary steps to reduce the impact on yield. Hence, this proposed 
model aims to detect the disease at an earlier stage. 
It uses image dataset of different diseases in this project.
